data cleaning needs to take place before algorithm can sufficently work.

1. Download custom projections from: https://apps.fantasyfootballanalytics.net/ 
2. download contest data from draftkings
3. Open excel file "name fix" and paste data from #1. This will give all players the proper name that is used on draftkings
4. Adjust teams and opponents in tab.
5. get ownership projections from PFF and paste in excel data cleaner called "Ownership".
6. PASTE results in solver_test
7. Run script "Risk_Multiple_runs" This is the main algorithm file. 


Diversification (USE NEW DIVERSIFY FOLDER).

8. New_diversify is the main algorithm to diversify lineup entries while allowing simultations.
9. paste algorithm output in New_Test_Diversify.csv and run script. 
10. Choose number of lineups wanted for entry at the top of the script.
11. paste combinations in New_Diversification_Output.csv into draftkings.
